3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars
LEVEL: Medium
You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.
While there is a '*', do the following operation:
Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaba*"
Output: "aab"
Explanation:
We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s becomes the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: "abc"
Explanation:
There is no '*' in the string.
